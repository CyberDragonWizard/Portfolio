                                        Whether if it is front-end, back-end, logic, or styling, I love
                                        pushing myself to solve problems and grow as a developer. Throughout
                                        my whole life, I've always found passion in projects that allows
                                        me to use my technically and creative mind.

                                        In my free time, I'm always making music. I love to play guitar,
                                         but drums are my passion and my entire life outside of work.
